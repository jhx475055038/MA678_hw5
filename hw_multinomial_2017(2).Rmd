## Multinomial logit: 
Using the individual-level survey data from the 2000 National Election Study (data in folder nes), predict party identification (which is on a 7-point scale) using ideology and demographics with an ordered multinomial logit model.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
nes5200<-read.dta("http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/examples/nes/nes5200_processed_voters_realideo.dta")
#saveRDS(nes5200,"nes5200.rds")
#nes5200<-readRDS("nes5200.rds")
# logistic regression of vote preference on income
nes5200_dt <- data.table(nes5200)
  yr <- 2000
nes5200_dt_s<-nes5200_dt[ year==yr,]
nes5200_dt_s$income <- droplevels(nes5200_dt_s$income)
nes5200_dt_s$partyid7 <- droplevels(nes5200_dt_s$partyid7)

nes5200_dt_s$gender <- factor(nes5200_dt_s$gender, labels=c("male", "female"))
nes5200_dt_s$race <- factor(nes5200_dt_s$race, labels=c("white", "black", "asian", 
                                    "native american", "hispanic"))
nes5200_dt_s$south <- factor(nes5200_dt_s$south)
nes5200_dt_s$ideo <- factor(nes5200_dt_s$ideo, labels=c("liberal", "moderate", "conservative"))

nes_data_comp<-nes5200_dt_s[complete.cases(nes5200_dt_s[,list(partyid7,income,ideo,female,white)])]
nes_data_comp$ideology <- scale(nes_data_comp$ideo_feel,center=TRUE)
```
1. Summarize the parameter estimates numerically and also graphically. 

```{r}
require(VGAM)
mod1<-polr(partyid7~ideo+race+age+gender, data=nes_data_comp)
summary(mod1)
coefplot(mod1)
```

2. Explain the results from the fitted model.
```{r}
confint(mod1)
# According to the confidence interval, most coefficients are significant except raceasian and racenative american, which cross 0. And from the summary of the mod1, I realize that independent-democrat|independent-independent and weak democrat|independent-democrat are not very significant. But, we should not ignore them.
```

3. Use a binned residual plot to assess the fit of the model.
```{r}
data<-na.omit(data.frame(cbind(partyid7=nes_data_comp$partyid7,ideo=nes_data_comp$ideo, race=nes_data_comp$race, age=nes_data_comp$age, gender=nes_data_comp$gender)))
pr<-model.matrix(~factor(partyid7)-1, data=data)-fitted(mod1)
pred=fitted(mod1)
##pr <-data.frame(data[,colnames(pred)]/rowSums(data[,colnames(pred)])-pred)
par(mfrow=c(2,3))
for(i in 1:6) binnedplot(pred[,i],pr[,i])
```




# High School and Beyond 
The hsb data was collected as a subset of the High School and Beyond study conducted by the National Education Longitudinal Studies program of the National Center for Education Statistics. The variables are gender; race; socioeconomic status; school type; chosen high school program type; scores on reading, writing, math, science, and social studies. We want to determine which factors are related to the choice of the type of program—academic, vocational, or general—that the students pursue in high school. The response is multinomial with three levels.

```{r}
data(hsb)
?hsb
```

1. Fit a trinomial response model with the other relevant variables as predictors (untransformed).
```{r}
library(nnet)
mod2<-multinom(prog~read+write+math+science+socst+schtyp+gender, data=hsb,trace=FALSE)
summary(mod2)
```

2. For the student with id 99, compute the predicted probabilities of the three possible choices.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
newdata<-filter(hsb,id=="99")
predict(mod2,newdata=newdata, type="probs")
```


# Happiness
Data were collected from 39 students in a University of Chicago MBA class and may be found in the dataset `happy`.
```{r}
library(faraway)
data(happy)
?happy

```

1. Build a model for the level of happiness as a function of the other variables.
```{r}
library(nnet)
mod3<-multinom(happy~money+sex+love+work,data=happy,trace=FALSE)
summary(mod3)
```

2. Interpret the parameters of your chosen model.
```{r}
confint(mod3)
## Form the confidence intervals, I realize that in different happiness scale, the significances of coefficients are different. But, generally money is the most significant predictor. To interpret the parameter, let's take a look on happiness scale>5. The interpretation is logit(happy>6)=6.63money-29.02sex-9.83love-20.71work+56.17
```

3. Predict the happiness distribution for subject whose parents earn $30,000 a year,
who is lonely, not sexually active and has no job.
```{r}
predict(mod3,newdata=data.frame(love=1,sex=0,work=1,money=30),type="prob")
```

# newspaper survey on Vietnam War
A student newspaper conducted a survey of student opinions about the Vietnam War in May 1967. Responses were classified by sex, year in the program and one of four opinions. The survey was voluntary. The data may be found in the dataset `uncviet`.  Treat the opinion as the response and the sex and year as predictors. Build a proportional odds model, giving an interpretation to the estimates.

```{r}
data(uncviet)
?uncviet
mod4<-polr(policy~sex+year,data=uncviet,weights=y)
summary(mod4)
coefplot(mod4)

```

# pneumonoconiosis of coal miners
The pneumo data gives the number of coal miners classified by radiological examination into one of three categories of pneumonoconiosis and by the number of years spent working at the coal face divided into eight categories.

```{r}
library(faraway)
data(pneumo,package="faraway")
?pneumo
```

1. Treating the pneumonoconiosis status as response variable as nominal, build a model for predicting the frequency of the three outcomes in terms of length of service and use it to predict the outcome for a miner with 25 years of service.

```{r}
mod5<-multinom(formula=status~Freq+year,data=pneumo, family=multinomial, Hess=TRUE)
summary(mod5)
```

2. Repeat the analysis with the pneumonoconiosis status being treated as ordinal. 

```{r}
mod55<-polr(status~Freq+year,data=pneumo, Hess=TRUE)
summary(mod55)

```

3.Now treat the response variable as hierarchical with top level indicating whether
the miner has the disease and the second level indicating, given they have the
disease, whether they have a moderate or severe case. 

```{r}
pneumo$disease<-1


```

4.  Compare the three analyses.

```{r}

```
